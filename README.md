# tool-path-for-ISF
A repository that contains tool path generation for Incremental Sheet Metal Forming

# About the Project
Incremental sheet metal forming is a novel manufacturing technique which involves forming a sheet metal iteratively using a round-tipped tool as the end-effector to a robotic manipulator/a CNC machine.
The angle at which shear is applied cannot be greater than a threshold angle in which case the sheet metal fails. Therefore, the tool-path for such an operation cannot be generated by existing sofwares in 3D modelling apps.

An attempt has been made to devise algorithms which takes this constraint into the consideration.

The algorithm:
1. Input: The input to the algorithm is a step-file. However, the local slope of the geometry cannot be determined using a step file.
2. The step file is converted to an .stl file which contains approximation of the surface in the form of small triangles.
3. The slope of triangles information is then found, if the slope is greater than a critical slope, then, it is reduced to a smaller slope in iterations.
4. At each iteration, points are sampled in each iteration.
5. Tool path is geneated in the form of a helix that passes through the sampled points
